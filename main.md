# What is Sound?

## To the Physicist
> Sound is a vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure

## To the Psychologist
> Sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain

# Types of Synthesis

- Physically Based
- Additive
- Subtractive
- Frequency modulated
- Sample based

## Physically Based

Using mathematical models to emulate a sound (Stuff from Archer?)

## Sample Based

Straight forward, changing pitch of recorded or sampled waves to produce new sounds

## Additive

TODO image of sin + sin & audio

## Subtractive

What I'll use today, expansion later

## Frequency Modulated

Basics of this, multiplying sin waves

# The Elements of Synthesis

## Pitch
2. Timbre
3. Volume

## Todo: analysis of acoustic sound ITO these parts

# Subtractive Synthesis

- Oscillate harmonically rich wave - Pitch
- Filter - Timbre
- ASDR envelopes - Volume

- LFO - Variations on above

## Start with harmonically complex wave (what does that mean?)

Perfrom Fourier Transform of square wave?

Audio of rich (square) vs simple (sine)

## Add filters to reduce number of harmonics

intro to filters
filter analysis of low pass

comb filter

all with Audio

## ASDR

Not too much to talk about, simply modifying volume

# Example on Microkorg

# Conclusion
